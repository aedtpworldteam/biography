La La La La La La La La La La
La La La La La La La La La La
La La La La La La La La La La
Trenchkid...

[Bridge]

Vision 2025, I'm on the road again
I know that I can flex it, but I'm holding it in
I know that I'm suffering pain
All I need is you by my side every day

Vision 2025, I came from many wages
But right now I wanna pray to my God every day
Oh Lord, if You hear my prayers
Always give me blessing and grace

[Verse]

Oh, I came from so many wages right now
When I thank You, all the grace right now
I know so many passing through a lot
But ’em bless wanna grief right now

Just wanna thank You for the life and the sins but
I just—if You ever forgiven any of our sins maybe
I didn’t know that there would be suffering all day
Just wanna be saved

I know that I’m so different, that’s why I’m one
Just wanna give ’em little one of one
I wanna love all my fans, yeah yeah
Please God, forgive their sins

I know that they all different
I know that they were different
But I know that so many wages I pass through
I know some moments where the plus three I had asked through

I know so many way dey your life
I know life is goin’ be hard
But you have to thrive so much
‘Cause so many wages that we came from, no lie

Sometimes, a great that you fall
Life pass through in your eyes
I know people wouldn’t even understand you
But please have some hope and a faith

I know somebody great life, just make it great
So many lives, a big lot of fame
So many lives, I know that I
You better learn, like so am I

If you fall down, you have to rise up
Maybe twice, or if you calm down
Make it a little lesson in your way
Know you always such to be great

I’m not going live off every pain
I’m not going live, maybe great
But it’s a good life
Oh, it’s a good life

So I urge you, please just hold on, make it great
If it choke all of you, you would be in great
Trust God in your own life —
A VISION 2025

[Bridge – Repeat]

Vision 2025, I'm on the road again
I know that I can flex it
But I'm holding it in
I know that I'm suffering pain
All I need is you by my side every day

Vision 2025, I came from many wages
But right now I wanna pray to my God every day
Oh Lord, if You hear my prayers
Always give me blessing and grace
